🏡 House Price Prediction in Bangalore using Machine Learning
This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices in Bangalore based on features such as location, square footage, and number of rooms.

📊 Dataset
The dataset includes property listings with attributes like:

Location

Total square feet

Number of bedrooms (BHK)

Number of bathrooms


🧹 Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps included:

Removing null values

Feature engineering (e.g., converting textual data to numerical)

Outlier removal

Handling categorical variables

🧠 Model Selection
We tested multiple machine learning algorithms using GridSearchCV combined with ShuffleSplit cross-validation to select the best model and hyperparameters.

Algorithms tested:

Linear Regression

Lasso Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Each model was evaluated for best performance using a custom function that compares their cross-validation scores and optimal hyperparameters.

📈 Final Output
The best-performing model can now predict house prices given property features. This model can be further deployed in a web app or used for decision-making in real estate analysis.
